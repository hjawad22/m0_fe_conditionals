# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?

I feel pretty confident in the comparison operators and think they are pretty easy to remember.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
I also feel that I understand logical operators and how they are used.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
After spending so time with the if statements I feel like I have a much better understanding of them.

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?

I spent way more time on it then estimated but thats because I tend to need more time to see it, read it, then do it. That just has to do with my learning style. 

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I still need to learn the different ways we can use if statements and how to translate the directions into the code. I will find a time in my calendar and make it happen. I do not need to adjust much because I left home for contingency.

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need? I still have many questions, I will google them and fing the answer, ask in class, and use the slack channel if I cannot find an anwser.
